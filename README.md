    Add jQuery to this code: http://pastebin.com/pSysQTV6 (download it or create a new index.html file and put that code inside)

    Add a button to your index.html.

    Show an alert when page has finished loading.

    Add a textbox with the id “alias”, and put the cursor inside it right after alert closes.

    Attach an event to the created button which calls a function that gets a response from http://bootcamp.aws.af.cm/welcome/tunombre

    Write the response to a div element.

    Show div content in red when a server error occurs.

    Take some free air and then create a function to highlight your name in the server response content. Call it right after setting the response inside the div.

    AJAX: get the response from http://search.twitter.com/search.json with parameter data "q=html5"
    First show response in firebug’s console log to analyze data, then display tweets inside a floated div in the middle of the screen.
    For each tweet show: from_user, text, created_at, profile_image_url.
    Add a transparent background covering the whole screen behind the tweets div so the background gets dimmed.
